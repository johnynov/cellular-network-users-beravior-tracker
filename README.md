# cellular-network-users-beravior-tracker
Topic: Modelling cell network' users behavior based on BTS anonim data - wtitten in Python and powered by open maps API.
This is students project conducted on Ms.C. studies on AGH University Cracow, Poland.

Project consists three steps:
1. Estimating paths -  based on distance from three BTS's we calculate user position and further - paths. 
2. Laying paths on open source maps with objects identification- Goole maps or open street maps / simmilar. Recognising users   behavior reason based on objects on the maps.
3. Providing behavior and location based offers to users by non-yet-defined channel of communication.
